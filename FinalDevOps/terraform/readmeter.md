# Terraform Provider for StackPath

The StackPath provider is a plugin for Terraform to interact with resources on the StackPath edge platform. It is publicly available on the [Terraform registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackpath/stackpath/latest). Please see the [official documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/stackpath/stackpath/latest/docs) to get started.

## Provider development

### Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12+ (to run acceptance tests)
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.16+ (to build the provider plugin)

### Building the provider

Run the following command to build the provider:

```sh
$ make build
```

### Installing the built provider for Terraform < 0.13
Run the following command to install the built provider:

```sh
$ make install
```

Once the plugin has been installed, run `terraform init` to have terraform discover the StackPath plugin.

### Installing the built provider for Terraform >= 0.13
Make sure that your terraform config is setup to mirror local providers:
Something like this should be in your `~/.terraformrc`
```
provider_installation {
  filesystem_mirror {
    path    = "/Users/USERNAME/terraform-providers/"
    include = ["local/providers/*"]
  }
  direct {
    exclude = ["local/providers/*"]
  }
}
```

Run the following command to install the built provider:

```sh
$ make install-13
```

Once the plugin has been installed, run `terraform init` to have terraform discover the StackPath plugin.


### Testing the provider

Run the following command to run the provider's unit tests:

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of acceptance tests, run `make testacc`. You must declare a valid StackPath stack ID or slug, API client ID, and API client secret in the `STACKPATH_STACK_ID`, `STACKPATH_CLIENT_ID`, and `STACKPATH_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables:

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run. 

```sh
$ STACKPATH_STACK_ID=my-stack-id STACKPATH_CLIENT_ID=my-client-id STACKPATH_CLIENT_SECRET=my-client-secret make testacc
```
